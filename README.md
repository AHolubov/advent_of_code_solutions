# advent_of_code_solutions
My solutions to AoC problems, organized by days

Since the problem for each day is divided into 2 similar parts each day folder will have at least a main.cpp and a main-2.cpp for the different solutions with other potential changes. 
Just collecting my practice examples here. Might or might not come in handy in an interview.
